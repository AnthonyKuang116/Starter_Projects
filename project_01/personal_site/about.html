                        I've always had an interest in STEM, which eventually led me to obtaining a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences from Virginia Tech in 2019. After obtaining a 
                        B.S. degree I found a new passion in programming and decided to change careers. I enrolled in FullyStack Academy through Virginia Tech in 2021 to follow my new
                        interest in programming.

                    <p>During the spring, summer, and autumn seasons I love playing tennis! I started when I joined my high school's varsity tennis team and fell in love
                    with the sport ever since. My senior year of high school my team and I placed 4th in the state of Virginia in 2015. I've kept up with tennis
                    since high school and played it recreationally in college and has become one of my favorite past times.
                    </p>
                    <p>When it's winter and I can't play tennis, I enjoy skiing. I learned how to ski during my freshman year of college and found the sport really fun!
                    Every year I try to plan a couple ski trips during the winter with some friends.

                    <p>I'm also a gaming enthusiast, whether it be board games, card games, or video games I enjoy them all! It's a good pastime activity during the time
                    we're staying indoors due to the global pandemic. Some of my favorite games include: Betrayal at the House on the Hill, Deception, Code Names, Skyblocks, 
                    and Phasmophobia.
                    <p>My other hobby include looking at stocks. I've always had an interest throughout high school but I didn't actually start trading until I entered college. 
                    I've been trading for 4 years as a way to generate more income. Trading also has me up-to-date on news and events. I've learned how to read financial reports, 
                    analyze patterns, and recognize good trades. I feel that everyone should invest in the market during some point in their life whether they actively trade or are 
                    just buying long term stocks/ETFs.
